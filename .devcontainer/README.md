This definition, copied from the VS Code 
[standard definition](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/java),
allows us to use a 
[Visual Studio remote container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and also 
[GitHub Codespaces]( https://github.com/features/codespaces) as our IDE.
